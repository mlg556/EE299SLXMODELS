# EE299SLXMODELS
These are the SIMULINK .slx models I have designed in my summer internship using NXP's [Model Based Design Toolbox,](https://www.nxp.com/support/developer-resources/run-time-software/automotive-software-and-tools/model-based-design-toolbox:MC_TOOLBOX) which is needed to generate code from the models.
